The project consists of two flows

  1. `XKCDData` - polls [xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com) periodically to fetch the latest comic,
     tracked as [**a data asset**, `xkcd`](data).

  2. `XKCDExplainer` - triggered by either `XKCDData` or the `XKCDViewer` app via an event.
     It uses a local visual language model, tracked as [**a model asset**, `explainer-vlm`](model),
     to explain a comic.

In addition to the flows, the project includes [an interactive (Steamlit) dashboard](deployments)

  - `XKCDViewer` which you can use to browse past comics and choose to trigger an explanation for one.
