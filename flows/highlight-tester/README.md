You can highlight key results from flows on the project overview
page by creating a special `@highlight` card. In effect, this
allows you to turn the overview page into an automatically
updating dashboard ðŸ“Š.

This flow demonstrates the styles available for `@highlights`.
Trigger a run on the workflows page and pick a `style` parameter
out of the following options:

 - `animals`
 - `nyan`
 - `image`
 - `small_square`
 - `tall_image`
 - `wide_image`
 - `revenue`
 - `busy`

After the run has completed, you should see a card showing up
on the overview page.

[Take a look the source
code](https://github.com/outerbounds/ob-project-starter/blob/main/flows/highlight_tester/flow.py) to get
an idea how you can customize highlights for your own projects.
